# 🚀 AB Tester Project

This project uses Docker to easily run all required services (backend, frontend, database, and cache).

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have installed:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

## 📁 Important Structure

For the project to work correctly, your folder structure should look like this:

```id="1n2k8f"
/parent-folder
│
├── ab-tester-ui
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   ├── .env
│   └── /src
│
└── ab-tester-ui   ← IMPORTANT (must be a sibling folder, not inside backend)
```

⚠️ **The `ab-tester-ui` folder must NOT be inside the backend project.**
It needs to be at the same level (as a sibling directory), because the `frontend` service mounts it as a volume using a relative path (`../ab-tester-ui`).

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Copy the environment variables file:

```bash id="ojbn1u"
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file if you need to customize any values.

## ▶️ Run the project

To start all services, run:

```bash id="0t72d4"
docker compose up
```

This will start:

* 🐘 PostgreSQL on port `5432`
* ⚡ Redis on port `6379`
* 🧠 Backend at `http://localhost:4000`
* 💻 Frontend at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔄 Development

Code changes are automatically reflected thanks to the configured Docker volumes.

## 🛑 Stop services

To stop the containers:

```bash id="m5iz7a"
docker compose down
```

## 🧩 Additional Notes

* If you run into dependency issues, rebuild the images:

```bash id="uk5v1q"
docker compose up --build
```

* If TypeScript types or IntelliSense are not working properly in Visual Studio Code, you can install dependencies locally with:

```bash id="e6o6jk"
npm ci
```

This helps ensure your editor correctly recognizes types and avoids IDE-related issues.

* Make sure ports `3000`, `4000`, `5432`, and `6379` are available.

You're all set! 🚀
